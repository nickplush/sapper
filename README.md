# Deploying an application
Before deploying an application to a local device, all library packages must be installed. To do this, open the console
and go to the root folder of the project. After that, write the command "npm i" of 'npm install' and wait for the
installation to complete.
After that, you need to write the command "npm start" in the terminal and the application will open on port 3000.

To start the game, just press the start button. In this case, the game will start with standard settings.
It is possible to return to the menu by clicking on the "home" icon, or restart the game with the selected settings by
clicking on the "restart" icon
